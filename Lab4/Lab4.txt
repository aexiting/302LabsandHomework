When I implemented the BadPartition function, it originally passed but after running it multiple times,
it would fail half of the time.

The linear sort seemed to the most fast at .11 seconds when the size was 16384. However the Bad selection sort
had finished after .24. Also the random Selection sort had a StackOverflow error when n = 32768.

I believe the Linear Partitioning would be the fastest since it makes sure that you are making the least amount of
accesses to the array. To calculate the medians you need n accesses to find the medians of 5 element sequences then you need n/5
to compare the medians and this guarantees that there you only need n/2 accesses to find the ith smallest element.
