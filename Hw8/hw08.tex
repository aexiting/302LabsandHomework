The vehicle Routing Problem or VRP is a problem is finding the optimal route for a number of vehicles to traverse the set of stops and roads that connect these stops. Each stop may or may not have a customer which requires a certain number of each resource. And usually, each vehicle can only carry a finite amount of materials. Some common goals of optimization is minimizing the driving time for each vehicle or using the least amount of vehicles to reach all customers under a time constraint. These goals can be considered constraints for a valid answer. Naturally, with the more constraints, the problem becomes more difficult to optimize, since one solution which improves one component often does so at the otherâ€™s expense.  This problem has countless applications in distribution.\\

The graph problem defined by Gilbert Laporte, is as follows: Let $G=(V,A)$ be a graph where $V={1,2...n}$ is a set of vertices representing cities with the depot located at vertex $1$, and $A$ is the set of arcs. With every arc $(i,j) i \neq j$ is associated a non-negative distance matrix $C = (c_{ij})$. Note that $c_{ij}$ can also be interpreted as a travel cost or a travel time. When $C$ is symmetrical, we can replace $A$ with $E$ which is a set of undirected edges.  In addition, assume there are $m$ vehicles available at the depot, where they are all located at the start of the algorithm. (Fin Gilbert Laporte)
