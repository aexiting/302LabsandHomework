When I first finished my program and got it working. I tried it on the first case and got outputs that were similar to what was shown on the
assignment. On the second case, it seemed like my program wasn't working properly. So I decided to check how I make choices. The size of the input made it difficult to discover the
issue so I thought about it more conceptually. My program's algorithm seemed greedy, and this might have caused it to fail in the second instance. My algorithm seems to choose
to use an ape unless there aren't enough bananas. I checked the bounds of the loops and conditionals that I use to find the apes that are needed for the optimal answer.
But that didn't change the result. So I decided to check how I fill the table. I tried to change the decision so that it would compare using all apes as a first move
and choose the one which will bring the most bananas. But I ran into a few issues and I went back to the algorithm that most closely resembled my recurrence.

I tried again for a program that tried using all monkeys then choosing monkey who brings the most bananas back first. However,
I had a few bugs with the program so that the only instance that worked was the second one. For some reason, it was allowing apes that carry more bananas then existed
to be used.
