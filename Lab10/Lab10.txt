I first decided to try to apply the algorithm in the instructions given in class. First I tried to write the method without changing the arguments. I started with the base chase which
compares the amount of work done by the truck in the current solution and the best solution found so far. I did this by creating an ArrayList and filling it with weights. Which makes it the
same size as each package. Then I would add package to the delivery, remove it from the candidates and then do a recursive call with the solution and the new candidates. Then I remove the choice
after the recursive call. When I ran my program, the output was a series of zeros. I tried to check if the for loop was running by adding the appropriate print statements but it still did not
change the output. I believe this is due to my loop being based on the number of candidates, which meant that the size of the array was zero. Another possible cause,
is an issue with pointers. Since,
